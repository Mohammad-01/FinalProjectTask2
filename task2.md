# Linux Operating System
Linux is a Unix-like operating system developed by the Linux community for PCs, servers, mainframes, mobile devices, and embedded devices. It is one of the most commonly used operating systems, having support for practically every major computer platform, including the x86, ARM, and SPARC architectures.
Linux was designed to be similar to UNIX, but it has since evolved to run on a variety of hardware, including phones and supercomputers. Every Linux-based operating system includes the Linux kernel, which manages hardware resources, as well as a collection of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system.
The operating system includes some common basic components, such as the GNU tools. These programs enable the user to manage the kernel's resources, install additional software, adjust performance and security settings, and do other things. When all of these tools are combined, they form the operating system, because Linux is an open source operating system, different Linux distributions have different software combinations.
Linux ingredients : 
Kernel
The fundamental component of the operating system. The operating system will not function without it. The kernel manages the system's resources and communicates with the hardware. It is in charge of memory, processes, and file management.

The system's user space
The administrative layer is in charge of system-level functions such as configuration and software installation. The shell, or command line, daemons, or background processes, and the desktop environment, or user interface, are all part of this.

Applications
Applications are a type of software that allows you to perform a specific task. Apps include things like desktop tools and programming languages, as well as multiuser corporate suites. Most Linux distributions have a central database where users may look for and download extra software.


# Windows Operating System 
Microsoft Windows, or simply Windows, is a grouping of proprietary graphical operating system families developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family is dedicated to a specific aspect of the computing industry.
Microsoft Windows, also known as Windows or Windows OS, was the first operating system to provide an IBM-compatible computer with a graphical user interface (GUI).
Since its initial release in 1985, Microsoft's Windows operating system has gone through nine major revisions.
It is characterized by ease of use and easy to understanding and simple to navigation between files and the good graphical user interface.

# GitHub 
GitHub is a service that hosts Git repositories as well as providing a number of additional functions. While Git is a command-line application, GitHub features a web-based graphical user interface. For each project, it also offers access control as well as a number of collaboration features such as wikis and simple task management systems.
It's a version control system that runs on the web. Git simplifies project collaboration by streamlining the process of collaborating with others. Members of the team can work on files and easily merge their modifications into the master branch of the project.
To access and manage projects on GitHub.com, use the standard Git command-line interface; all standard Git commands work with it. Users can also browse GitHub.com's public repositories. A number of desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. The site includes social networking features such as feeds, followers, wikis (created with Gollum wiki software), and a social network graph that shows how developers collaborate on different versions of a repository ("forks") and which fork (and branch within that fork) is the most recent.

# GitLab
GitLab is an open-source web-based DevOps lifecycle solution built by GitLab Inc. that includes a Git repository manager, wiki, issue-tracking, and continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
As a source code management solution for collaborating on software development within a team, the code was originally created in Ruby, with some pieces later rewritten in Go. It later evolved into a comprehensive solution that covered the full software development life cycle, as well as the entire DevOps life cycle. The technological stack presently includes Go, Ruby on Rails, and Vue.js.
The core functionality is distributed under an open-source (MIT) license, but the additional functionality is distributed under a proprietary license.
The main difference between GitHub and GitLab is the platform that each ideology offers. GitLab is more focused on providing a features-based system with a centralized, integrated platform for web developers, whereas GitHub is more focused on infrastructure performance and offers greater availability.

Task 1 (2)

So I will use Visual Studio Code for coding with HTML, JS and CSS because it’s easy for use and all its features are good and help me get the job done quickly and correctly without any errors, I will use also GitHub because It’s so helpful when we work as a team and it’s good to tracking what’s the changed that happen on the code the thing that will help us not to confront conflicts in code and I will use Linux operating system because has a high security, open Source,  ease of maintenance, runs on any hardware and ease of use.
VS Code lets us to be productive in seconds with syntax highlighting, bracket matching, auto-indentation, box selection, snippets, and more.
It's easy to traverse your code and save time and effort with intuitive keyboard shortcuts, simple customization, and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings.
And GitHub because it includes a large number of large organizations, it is best to display projects after they have been completed, also Easy Version Control, Secure Cloud Storage and the Largest Shared Repository.
