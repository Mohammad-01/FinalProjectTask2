# Linux Operating System
Linux is a Unix-like operating system developed by the Linux community for PCs, servers, mainframes, mobile devices, and embedded devices. It is one of the most commonly used operating systems, having support for practically every major computer platform, including the x86, ARM, and SPARC architectures.
Linux was designed to be similar to UNIX, but it has since evolved to run on a variety of hardware, including phones and supercomputers. Every Linux-based operating system includes the Linux kernel, which manages hardware resources, as well as a collection of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system.
The operating system includes some common basic components, such as the GNU tools. These programs enable the user to manage the kernel's resources, install additional software, adjust performance and security settings, and do other things. When all of these tools are combined, they form the operating system, because Linux is an open source operating system, different Linux distributions have different software combinations.
Linux ingredients : 
Kernel
The fundamental component of the operating system. The operating system will not function without it. The kernel manages the system's resources and communicates with the hardware. It is in charge of memory, processes, and file management.

The system's user space
The administrative layer is in charge of system-level functions such as configuration and software installation. The shell, or command line, daemons, or background processes, and the desktop environment, or user interface, are all part of this.

Applications
Applications are a type of software that allows you to perform a specific task. Apps include things like desktop tools and programming languages, as well as multiuser corporate suites. Most Linux distributions have a central database where users may look for and download extra software.


# Windows Operating System 
Microsoft Windows, or simply Windows, is a grouping of proprietary graphical operating system families developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family is dedicated to a specific aspect of the computing industry.
Microsoft Windows, also known as Windows or Windows OS, was the first operating system to provide an IBM-compatible computer with a graphical user interface (GUI).
Since its initial release in 1985, Microsoft's Windows operating system has gone through nine major revisions.
It is characterized by ease of use and easy to understanding and simple to navigation between files and the good graphical user interface.

# GitHub 
GitHub is a service that hosts Git repositories as well as providing a number of additional functions. While Git is a command-line application, GitHub features a web-based graphical user interface. For each project, it also offers access control as well as a number of collaboration features such as wikis and simple task management systems.
It's a version control system that runs on the web. Git simplifies project collaboration by streamlining the process of collaborating with others. Members of the team can work on files and easily merge their modifications into the master branch of the project.
To access and manage projects on GitHub.com, use the standard Git command-line interface; all standard Git commands work with it. Users can also browse GitHub.com's public repositories. A number of desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. The site includes social networking features such as feeds, followers, wikis (created with Gollum wiki software), and a social network graph that shows how developers collaborate on different versions of a repository ("forks") and which fork (and branch within that fork) is the most recent.

# GitLab
GitLab is an open-source web-based DevOps lifecycle solution built by GitLab Inc. that includes a Git repository manager, wiki, issue-tracking, and continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
As a source code management solution for collaborating on software development within a team, the code was originally created in Ruby, with some pieces later rewritten in Go. It later evolved into a comprehensive solution that covered the full software development life cycle, as well as the entire DevOps life cycle. The technological stack presently includes Go, Ruby on Rails, and Vue.js.
The core functionality is distributed under an open-source (MIT) license, but the additional functionality is distributed under a proprietary license.
The main difference between GitHub and GitLab is the platform that each ideology offers. GitLab is more focused on providing a features-based system with a centralized, integrated platform for web developers, whereas GitHub is more focused on infrastructure performance and offers greater availability.

Task 1 (3)

## The reasons of using Visual Studio Code IDE :

Visual Studio Code is a programming environment for writing software. VS Code lets you to be productive in seconds with syntax highlighting, bracket matching, auto-indentation, box selection, snippets, and more.
It's easy to traverse your code and save time and effort with intuitive keyboard shortcuts, simple customization, and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings.
You'll often benefit from tools that understand more code than just blocks of text if you're doing significant coding. Visual Studio Code has IntelliSense code completion, sophisticated semantic code understanding and navigation, and code refactoring.
When things get difficult in the coding department, the brave turn to debugging. Debugging is possible in Visual Studio Code, which is frequently the functionality developers miss the most in a leaner coding environment. Using the interactive debugger included with Visual Studio Code, you can step through source code, inspect variables, view call stacks, and run commands in the console.
To automate routine tasks and streamline workflows, VS Code integrates with build and scripting tools. Git support has been added to VS Code, allowing you to interact with source control without ever leaving the editor, including examining pending changes diffs.

All these reasons make me to choose Visual Studio Code to build my website so it will help us with writing code and spend less time also effort.

## The reasons of using Linux Operating System :

1. A high level of protection
Installing and using Linux on your PC is the simplest approach to avoid viruses and malware. Linux was developed with security in mind, and it is significantly less susceptible to infections than Windows.
2. Exceptionally stable
The Linux operating system is extremely stable and rarely crashes. The Linux operating system continues to run as quickly as it did when it was originally installed, even after several years. Most of us have witnessed how a newly installed Windows system performs incredibly well for six to twelve months before slowing down. Then, in most cases, reinstalling the operating system and all other software is your only alternative.
3. Simplicity of upkeep
The Linux operating system is simple to maintain since the user can easily update the operating system and all installed software from a central location. Every Linux distribution has its own central software repository, which is used to maintain the system up to date and secure. They provide regular updates, and the system can be upgraded without having to restart. Users can update their data on a regular basis with just a few clicks, or they can even automate the process. In comparison to a Linux system, updating a Windows system is more difficult. Under addition, in Windows, all third-party software such as Acrobat Reader and Firefox must be updated separately.
4. It is compatible with any computer.
We are all aware that with each new Windows OS release, a large number of hardware systems become obsolete because their technical specifications are no longer adequate to run the most recent Windows OS. Linux is particularly adept at making use of the system's resources. In a Linux system, users and unique hardware requirements can be catered to. The installation process is quite flexible, allowing users to select which modules to install. This allows them to install Linux on older technology and make the best use of all available hardware resources.
5. Ease of use
Linux is no longer solely for nerds, contrary to common opinion. It now has an excellent graphical user interface and is user-friendly (GUI). It has nearly all of the same functionality as Windows. The graphical user interface has progressed to the point that most of what ordinary users desire can be done on Linux just as simply as it can be done on Windows, and without having to know any commands.
6. Community Support 
On the Internet, there is a large community of Linux users who can be found in numerous forums. Because many volunteers are online and working to solve problems because of their passion of Linux, any query submitted in a forum will usually receive a speedy response.

## The reasons of using GitHub Version Control System :

A Massively Influential Group
GitHub is an open-source platform that is driven by the community. Millions of programmers and enthusiasts contribute to the community by downloading, reviewing, and rating their work.
GitHub is also the platform of choice for developers at a number of major corporations. Microsoft is the system's largest donor, but it also includes Google, SAP, AirBnB, IBM, PayPal, and a few other companies.
As a result, because it includes a large number of large organizations, it is best to display projects after they have been completed.
Also Easy Version Control, Secure Cloud Storage and the Largest Shared Repository.
