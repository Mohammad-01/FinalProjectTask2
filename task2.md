Task 2 (1) 
# Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code may be a lightweight code editor with debugging, task execution, and version control capabilities. It aims to supply developers with only the tools they have to finish a fast code-build-debug cycle, leaving more complex processes to full-featured IDEs like Visual Studio IDE, and it's free and open source. Visual Studio Code comes with variety of FTP extensions, making it a viable option for free of charge web development. Without the utilization of additional software, code are often synchronized between the editor and therefore the server. In Visual Studio code, you'll change the active document's code page, the document's newline character, and therefore the active document programing language. It works on any platform, in any location, and in any programing language. ## Features : * Language support : Visual Studio Code includes basic support for the bulk of popular programming languages. * Data collection : Visual Studio Code collects and sends usage data to Microsoft. * Version management : Visual Studio Code includes source control as a typical feature, a fanatical tab within the menu bar allows you to access version control options and monitor changes to the present project. 
# PyCharm
PyCharm may be a programming integrated development environment (IDE) that focuses on the Python programing language. JetBrains, a Czech firm, created it (formerly referred to as IntelliJ). It comes with a code analyzer, graphical debugger, integrated unit tester, VCS integration, also as support for Django web development and Anaconda data science. PyCharm is out there in versions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The Community Edition is governed by the Apache License, but the Professional Edition, which has more features, is governed by a proprietary license.
## Features:

* Cross-platform IDE with Customizability PyCharm are often used on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux employing a single license key. 

# Linux OS

Linux may be a Unix-like OS developed by the Linux community for PCs, servers, mainframes, mobile devices, and embedded devices. it's one among the foremost widely used operating systems, supporting most major computer platforms, including the x86, ARM, and SPARC architectures. Linux began as a UNIX-like OS, but it's now expanded to incorporate phones and supercomputers. Every Linux-based OS includes the Linux kernel, which manages hardware resources, also as a set of software packages that structure the remainder of the OS. Some common basic components, like the GNU tools, are included with the OS.These apps allow you to manage the kernel's resources, install additional software, tweak performance and security settings, and more. Because Linux is an open source OS, different Linux distributions have different software combinations when all of those tools are merged to form the OS.
Linux ingredients :
Kernel
The fundamental component of the OS. The OS won't function without it, the kernel is responsible of managing the system's resources and interacting with the hardware, it's responsible of memory, processes, and file management. 

The system's user space 
The administrative layer is responsible of system-level functions like configuration and software installation. The shell, or instruction, daemons, or background processes, and therefore the desktop environment, or interface, are all a part of this.

Applications 
Applications are pieces of software that enable you to try to to a selected tas, apps include things like desktop tools and programming languages, also as multiuser corporate suites. Most Linux distributions have a central database where users may search for and download extra software.

# Windows OS 
Microsoft Windows, or simply Windows, may be a collection of proprietary graphical OS families that Microsoft has developed and commercialized. Each family focuses on a special element of the pc business. Microsoft Windows, often referred to as Windows or Windows OS, was the primary OS to supply a graphical interface to an IBM-compatible computer (GUI). Since its original release in 1985, Microsoft's Windows OS has skilled nine significant revisions. It is distinguished by its simple use, understanding, and navigation between files, also as an honest graphical interface. 

# GitHub 

GitHub may be a service that hosts Git repositories and offers a spread of other features. GitHub features a web-based graphical interface, whereas Git may be a command-line tool. It also provides access control and a spread of collaborative tools, like wikis and straightforward task management systems, for every project. It's an internet-based version system. Git streamlines the method of collaborating with others, making project collaboration easier. Members of the team can work on files and quickly merge their changes into the project's master branch. Use the regular Git command-line interface to access and manage projects on GitHub.com; it supports all standard Git commands. Users also can browse the general public repositories on GitHub.com. There also are variety of desktop clients and Git plugins available. the location incorporates social networking elements including feeds, followers, wikis (made with Gollum wiki software), and a social network graph that shows how developers collaborate on different versions of a repository ("forks"), also as which fork (and branch within that fork) is that the most up-to-date.

# GitLab 
GitLab is an open-source web-based DevOps lifecycle solution built by GitLab Inc. that has a Git repository manager, wiki, issue-tracking, and continuous integration and deployment pipeline. As a ASCII text file management solution for collaborating on software development within a team, the code was originally created in Ruby, with some pieces later rewritten in Go. It later evolved into a comprehensive solution that covered the complete software development life cycle, also because the entire DevOps life cycle. The technological stack presently includes Go, Ruby on Rails, and Vue.js. The core functionality is distributed under an open-source (MIT) license, but the extra functionality is distributed under a proprietary license. The main difference between GitHub and GitLab is that the platform that every ideology offers. GitLab is more focused on providing a features-based system with a centralized, integrated platform for web developers, whereas GitHub is more focused on infrastructure performance and offers greater availability.

Task 2 (2)

So i will be able to use Visual Studio Code for coding with HTML, JS and CSS because it’s easy to be used and every one its features are good and help me get the work done quickly and properly with none errors, i will be able to use also GitHub because It’s so helpful once we work as a team and it’s good to tracking what’s the changed that happen on the code the thing which will help us to not confront conflicts in code and that i will use Linux OS because features a high security, open Source, simple maintenance, runs on any hardware and simple use.With syntax highlighting, bracket matching, auto-indentation, box selection, snippets, and more, VS Code allows us to be productive in seconds.It's easy to traverse your code and save time and energy with intuitive keyboard shortcuts, simple customization, and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings.And GitHub because it includes an outsized number of huge organizations, it's best to display projects after they need been completed, also Easy Version Control, Secure Cloud Storage and therefore the Largest Shared Repository.

Pycharm disadvantages:

1- the foremost significant disadvantage of PyCharm is that it consumes more room than other text editors, leading to less code capability.

2- The community version is restricted to Python development and doesn't permit the utilization of other programming languages.

3- The professional edition may be a little pricey.

4- Because setting a virtual environment variable are often difficult for beginners, they'll avoid using it.

Windows disadvantages :

1- Resources are briefly supply.

2- Closed source.

3- Virus susceptibility thanks to a scarcity of security.

4- Licensing agreements that are outrageous.

5- Technical support is insufficient.

6- Additional costs.

7- Remote access is insufficient.

Gitlab disadvantages :

1- Its interface could also be slower than GitHub.

2- There are a couple of common issues with repositories.

Those disadvantages made me choose their competitors because they're going to affect negatively on our work.


Task 2 (3)

The reasons of using Visual Studio Code IDE :

You'll often enjoy tools that understand more code than simply blocks of text if you're doing significant coding, intelliSense code completion, complex semantic code interpretation and navigation, and code refactoring are all available in Visual Studio Code.
When things get difficult within the coding department, the brave address debugging. Debugging is feasible in Visual Studio Code, which is usually the functionality developers miss the foremost during a leaner coding environment. Using the interactive debugger included with Visual Studio Code, you'll step through ASCII text file, inspect variables, view call stacks, and run commands within the console.
To automate routine tasks and streamline workflows, VS Code integrates with build and scripting tools. VS Code now offers Git support, allowing you to interact with source control without ever leaving the editor, including examining pending change diffs.
All these reasons make me to settle on Visual Studio Code to create my website so it'll help us with writing code and spend less time also effort.It is also easy to use and therefore the team members are all performing on it professionally due to its long-time use in writing code, which can make us not need time to find out the features and the way to work the program and the way to figure thereon. it'll help us to skip tons of your time in writing because it's a code completion feature.

The reasons of using Linux OS :

1. A high level of protectionInstalling and using Linux on your PC is that the simplest approach to avoid viruses and malware. Linux was developed with security in mind, and it's significantly less vulnerable to infections than Windows.

2. Exceptionally stableThe Linux OS is extremely stable and infrequently crashes. The Linux OS continues to run as quickly because it did when it had been originally installed, even after several years. Most folks have witnessed how a newly installed Windows system performs incredibly well for 6 to 12 months before slowing down. Then, in most cases, reinstalling the OS and every one other software is your only alternative.

3. Simplicity of upkeepThe Linux OS is straightforward to take care of since the user can easily update the OS and every one installed software from a central location. Every Linux distribution has its own central software repository, which is employed to take care of the system up so far and secure. they supply regular updates, and therefore the system are often upgraded without having to restart. Users can update their data on a daily basis with just a couple of clicks, or they will even automate the method. as compared to a Linux system, updating a Windows system is harder. Under addition, in Windows, all third-party software like Acrobat Reader and Firefox must be updated separately.

4. it's compatible with any computer.We are all aware that with each new Windows OS release, an outsized number of hardware systems become obsolete because their technical specifications are not any longer capable run the foremost recent Windows OS. Linux is especially adept at making use of the system's resources. during a Linux system, users and unique hardware requirements are often catered to. The installation process is sort of flexible, allowing users to pick which modules to put in. this enables them to put in Linux on older technology and make the simplest use of all available hardware resources.

5. simple useLinux is not any longer solely for nerds, contrary to common opinion. It now has a superb graphical interface and is user-friendly (GUI). it's nearly all of an equivalent functionality as Windows. The graphical interface has progressed to the purpose that the majority of what ordinary users desire are often done on Linux even as simply because it are often done on Windows, and without having to understand any commands.

6. Community Support On the web, there's an outsized community of Linux users who are often found in numerous forums. Because many volunteers are online and dealing to unravel problems due to their passion of Linux, any query submitted during a forum will usually receive a speedy response.We have all preferred to use a system Linux because there's little or no chance that it'll fail because any failure may expose us to the danger of delaying the completion of an outsized project like an internet site project for movies. It also works on all devices. Each member of the team features a different device type than the opposite. a number of them are old and a few are new. the issues that we may encounter with this technique are very simple.
And it takes a touch time compared to the Windows system, and if we'd like help thanks to a drag within the system, we will get help immediately, all of those reasons its first goal in choosing this technique is that we don't run into problems that make us delay in delivering the project to create an internet site for movies because we don't have much time.

The reasons of using GitHub Version system :

A Massively Influential GroupGitHub is an open-source platform that's driven by the community. many programmers and enthusiasts contribute to the community by downloading, reviewing, and rating their work.GitHub is additionally the platform of choice for developers at variety of major corporations. Microsoft is that the system's largest donor, but it also includes Google, SAP, AirBnB, IBM, PayPal, and a couple of other companies in our project, we'd like to write down collectively and increase and modify the code so as to accomplish the task of making an internet page for movies faster and also to figure as a team and reduce the trouble on each team member so we decided to use GitHub because it'll help us overcome this problem also that we'll publish Therefore, our project, which helps large companies see the projects that they're ready to complete, and increases the rates of obtaining employment.
